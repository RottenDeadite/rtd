		A Survival-Horror Browser MMO

	</div>
	<div class="content">
		Ipswitch is an online-only, browser based Massive Multiplayer RPG that I'm developing.  It started as a project to re-learn PHP and SQL after I got out of college,
		but some encouragement from the <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/">shacknews</a> community and the assistance of a few members is keeping me motivated.  Ipswitch
		is a Cthulhu Mythos-themed game that includes elements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic">Roadside Picnic</a>,
		<a href="http://www.silenthillmemories.net/">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="http://www.urbandead.com">Urban Dead</a>.  It features a "survival horror" gameplay style
		and a random and unpredictable world that drastically changes without warning.

	<div class="heading"><a href="ogame/index.php">Navigation &amp; Combat</a><br /></div>
	<div class="content">
		At any rate, this is the basic navigation page.  From here, players interact with the world and each other.  Many features don't work yet, such as unloading weapons.  Many
		other features aren't even present, like interior locations, day/night cycles, etc.  I've also been changing central portions of the code over to more object-oriented formats,
		so a lot of content is either broken or malfunctioning.  Expect things to work very poorly over the next few months.

	<div class="content">
		When you're in a space with a mob icon, you can attack that target via the "attack" action button.
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		I should also mention that, because I'm concentrating so hard on back-end development, this demonstration looks pretty ugly on Firefox, and like hell warmed over
		on anything else.

	<div class="heading"><a href="ogame/mapgenerator.experiment.php">Map Tests</a><br /></div>
	<div class="content">
		There are other "tech demo" pages that I've made to test logic and classes.  Currently they're focused on the random map generation technology, organization of the
		map layout, and ease of replication and location attribute management.
