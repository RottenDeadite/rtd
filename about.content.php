	<div class="content">
		In New Orleans, when I was young, I naively chased the dream of becoming a professional pen &amp; paper role-playing game designer until <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/">Steve Jackson</a> told me that the best way to quickly go broke was to design games.  Being either too practically minded or too obsessed with possessions I decided a career change was in order.
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		At that point the only thing I was good enough at to get paid for was web design.  My fellow gamer friends and I had established a <a href="http://www.peginc.com/">Deadlands</a> fan-site called "The Sixth Bullet."  The website featured some (badly written) JavaScript image rollovers, but they were good enough to land me my first job as a web designer at a company called Bailey Link.  Eventually put in charge of the construction and configuration of their cyber-cafe's network, I very quickly learned an important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Costanza">lesson</a>, which was to never take a job that I'm not qualified to perform.
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		My next few jobs went better, as I built on the lesson learned at Bailey Link and quickly expanded my knowledge to include system administration, network maintenance and computer construction among others.  It wasn't until the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">IT crash</a> in the late '90's that I decided that New Orleans wasn't going to sustain my career, so I moved to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=&amp;jsv=147d&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=32.472848,61.171875&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;geocode=FXcNAwId4VD4-g&amp;split=0">Atlanta</a>, got <a href="http://www.kauai-hawaii.com">married</a> and went back to <a href="http://dunwoody.aiuniv.edu">school</a> for the college degree my resume desperately needed.
	</div>
	<div class="content">
		It was in college that I learned a very important lesson that separates me from the millions of other system administrators and IT generalists in the industry: methodology is <em>critical</em>. It's not enough to be able to solve a problem. What's needed is an approach that finds the solution and then includes extra steps to ensure that the root cause of the problem is discovered and addressed. This ensures that the problem will not re-appear, but it must be done with care and determination: a precision operation that effects the minimum number of systems without detriment.

	<div class="content">
		Using connections I'd made from part-time work I'd obtained in order to help pay the bills while attending college full-time, I managed to pick up a position working for Jacki Viles, the head of the MovieStop division of the GameStop IT department.  Collectively, Jacki and I support over 50 retail stores nation-wide entirely by ourselves.  And now that we've bought MovieStop out from under the GameStop umbrella, I now set up, support and configure our enterprise-level servers and services as well.  Collectively there's not a single aspect of the MovieStop IT department that I haven't put my hand on.
