		An incredibly detailed examination of a work of fiction

	<h2 class="heading">What is the New Whirling School?</h2>
	<div>
		The award-winning video game "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind">The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind</a>" was released in May, 2002 by <a href="http://bgs.bethsoft.com/">Bethesda Game Studios</a>. A critical and financial success, <em>Morrowind</em> is still considered to be one of the best role playing games ever created, and garnered over 60 awards, including Game of the Year.

		Part of <em>Morrowind</em>'s appeal was its carefully crafted and detailed universe, much of which was explained to players by over 300 in-game books. Of particular interest to players was a series of books called "The 36 Lessons of Vivec." This strange collection of short stories, written in a style reminiscent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita">traditional Hindu epics</a>, is infamous among <em>Morrowind</em> fans as being prohibitively obtuse, confusing, and inaccessible. But many fans who attempt to discern meaning in this strange tale discover an internal logic and consistency which clearly hints at a deeply personal and spiritual message.

		<a href="http://www.newwhirlingschool.com">The New Whirling School</a> is my attempt at creating a compilation of commentaries on this mysterious book. It's a considerable undertaking. The author, <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,16258/">Michael Kirkbride</a>, is well known for his eclectic writing style. And having pulled from so many real-world sources, it's quite difficult to determine the meaning hidden behind the prose. Additional difficulty is added by the Elder Scrolls fan community's love of (to quote from the 36 Lessons) "inferring significance in things devoid of detail." So not only must I uncover the author's hidden messages, but I also explore nearly every line in the book and present as many reasonable interpretations as possible, even (or especially) when they conflict.
	</div>
	<h2 class="heading">Why bother?</h2>
	<div>
		The 36 Lessons of Vivec is a vitally important document in a critically acclaimed piece of entertainment. It serves as the primary source of information on the structure of the Elder Scrolls universe itself, in both the physical and metaphysical sense. And that's not even mentioning the most obvious mystery of the piece: "who killed Indoril Nerevar?"
	</div>
	<h2 class="heading">How do I start?</h2>
	<div>
		I've written an introduction in the <a href="http://www.newwhirlingschool.com">New Whirling School</a>'s website that should help ease you into the text, assuming you've never played the game. Afterwards, I'd recommend simply reading each of the Lessons and ignoring the annotations. Get an overview, and then plunge into the details. The annotations are where the real exploration starts, since I'm including links to thousands of external sources that range from theoretical physics to esoteric 16th-century hermetic philosophy. The New Whirling School can serve as a launching point to a fantastic and spiritual exploration of science, philosophy, religion, and biology. Allow yourself to become immersed.

		If you've got the right flavor of mind, you might find this mystical and fantastic story as rewarding as I have.
